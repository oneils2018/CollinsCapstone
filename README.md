Quick start guide. More information can be found in "Documentation.pdf"

# Graphical User Interface 
Easiest way to start and edit the code is by using a python IDE such as PyCharm.
PyCharm was mainly used to edit and start/stop the GUI.
Installing the modules can be done by adding modules to the Python Interperter setting. If an error or missing module occures, PyCharm can show advise on how to fix them like using pip.
Run GUI.py to start the GUI.

Model training can be done using google collab or a command line interface when using the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2.

The Tensorflow model "tensorflow_model.h5" and aedat4 file "Night_Vapor.aedat4" has to be plaved in the same folder as the other scripts. They can be downloaded through the link below or Teams.

# Tensorflow Notes
Tensorflow trained models are too large to store on github.

The current trained model can be downloaded via the link below: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IeBYIqjMfTfcQVr6pW-VIqHP-cFar_-D/view?usp=sharing

Here is the link to the google colab notebook containing the tensorflow model training code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18P014j4ePPQMr0vTkuVf0Oyw_M81OtjJ?usp=sharing
